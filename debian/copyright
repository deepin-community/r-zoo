This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-zoo package of zoo, a package with
a class for totally ordered indexed observations such as irregular
time series. Zoo was written by Achim Zeileis and Gabor Grothendieck,
and is maintained by Achim Zeileis <Achim.Zeileis@wu-wien.ac.at>.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from 
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'zoo' to 'r-cran-zoo'
to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages for R.
Additionally, 'r-zoo' was used as the source package name as a source
package 'zoo' is already part of the Debian archive.
